## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used COVID19 data from Kaggle to better understand:

1. How fast COVID19 spread throughout the world?
2. How countries did to counter the pandemic?
3. How my country India did?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the notebook Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb

## Dataset<a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kagle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
